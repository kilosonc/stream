# Stream

stream api for golang.

Stream operation in rust and js/ts is awesome, it keeps developer focusing on business logic, instread of coding itself.

But in golang, things are a little bit different, honestly it sucks.

This project referenced some of the interfaces in [lodash](https://lodash.com/).

Happy coding. :)
